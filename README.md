# University-enrollment
In this project, I conducted an analysis of enrollment trends at a university that introduced online courses to reach a wider student audience. Using machine learning regression techniques, I identified factors contributing to higher enrollment, with a specific focus on the influence of course type (online or classroom). The findings provided valuable insights for the university to optimize its educational offerings and cater to diverse student preferences. By leveraging data-driven predictions, the project facilitated informed decision-making, ensuring the university's adaptability to changing learning demands and enhancing accessibility for a broader range of students through online learning opportunities.
